# Front end

On the front end, I built a simple infrastructure using React. here you can see the files and directories:

-   src
    -   actions : Actions are a concept of classes that handle requests to the backend.
    -   components: Generic components used throughout the entire system.
    -   pages : Pages of your website
    -   utils : Utility functions and helpers.
-   vite.config.ts : This file configures Vite. Vite is lighter than using react-scripts.
-   .env-sample : A sample .env file.
-   .prettierrc : This file determines the formatting rules for your code.

## HOW TO START

First copy .env-sample and create a .env file

```
npm install
npm run start
```
